# Converter-in-Java
This is a converter which converts several quantities like numbers ,mass ,length etc. 

Minimum features of System required to run the program
1. 32-BIT Architecture 
2. 4 GB RAM
3. JDK(1.8)
4. Eclipse(Neon)
5. Xampp/mysql Server

Try to run it on eclipse(neon) because it supports the "Window Builer" feature and to avoid any issues .Do save all the data in the database before running it otherwise only you would be able to see the GUI only and only number conversion would be posssible . The whole application is built in Java Swing FrameWork along with JDBC connectivity.

However if any error comes do consult "you-tube" or mail me.
